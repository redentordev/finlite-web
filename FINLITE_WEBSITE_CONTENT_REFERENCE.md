```
Why FinLite?
```

#### Introduction Content
```
According to research by Edvisors (2025), over 60% of students struggle to stick to a personal budget due to lack of easy-to-use tools and financial education. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas reports that only 25% of Filipino youth demonstrate adequate financial literacy.

Existing budgeting apps are often too complex, loaded with advanced features designed for experienced users, and filled with intimidating terminology. This creates a significant barrier for beginners.

FinLite was built to close this gap. It's not a complex financial platform—it's your personal finance coach in your pocket. Designed specifically for beginners, FinLite removes the complexity and adds the support you need to develop healthy money management habits.
```

#### Problem Statement
```
The Challenge:
- Manual expense tracking is tedious and leads to abandoned records
- Existing apps are too complex and overwhelming for beginners
- Lack of motivational support makes it hard to stay engaged
- First-time budgeters often feel intimidated by financial technology

The Solution:
FinLite combines simplicity, automation, and encouragement to make financial management accessible and sustainable for everyone.
```

### 7.2 Features & Functionality

**Q: How does the receipt scanning work?**
```
A: Our AI-powered scanning uses advanced OCR technology to read receipts. 
Just take a photo, and the app automatically extracts the merchant, amount, 
date, and category. You can review and confirm before saving. It saves 
2-3 minutes per transaction!
```

**Q: Can I set up a budget?**
```
A: Absolutely! You can set a total monthly budget and per-category limits 
(Groceries, Transport, Dining, etc.). FinLite shows you real-time progress 
with color-coded indicators and alerts you before you overspend.
```

**Q: What happens if I overspend?**
```
A: FinLite alerts you as you approach your budget limit, giving you a chance 
to adjust spending. If you do overspend in a category, you'll get a friendly 
nudge suggesting ways to reduce spending, but you maintain full control over 
your finances.
```

**Q: Can I customize categories?**
```
A: Yes! The app comes with suggested categories, but you can create custom 
categories for your unique expenses. You can also modify categories anytime.
```

### 7.3 Privacy & Security

**Q: Do you sell my data?**
```

third parties. Your data is yours alone, and we use it only to improve your 
FinLite experience.
```

**Q: Who can see my financial information?**
```
A: Only you. Your financial data is private and accessible only when you 
log into your account. Even FinLite staff cannot access your personal data 
without your permission.
```

**Q: What happens to my data if I delete my account?**
```
A: All your data is permanently deleted within 90 days of account termination. 
You can also request a copy of your data before deletion via CSV or PDF export.
```

**Q: Does FinLite track my location?**
```
A: FinLite only collects your approximate location (country/region) based on 
your IP address for service purposes. We don't track your precise location 
unless you explicitly grant permission, which we don't require for basic features.

- Android (Android 11+)

Download from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

none! FinLite will remind you to log expenses if you go a few days without 
tracking.
```
